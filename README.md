## Installation - Build From Source

---

If you wish to compile MangoHud to keep up to date with any changes - first clone this repository and cd into it:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud.git
cd MangoHud
```

Using `meson` to install "manually":

```
meson build
ninja -C build install
```

By default, meson should install MangoHud to `/usr/local`. Specify install prefix with `--prefix=/usr` if desired.
Add `-Dappend_libdir_mangohud=false` option to meson to not append `mangohud` to libdir if desired (e.g. /usr/local/lib/mangohud).

To install 32-bit build on 64-bit distro, specify proper `libdir`: `lib32` for Arch, `lib/i386-linux-gnu` on Debian-based distros. RPM-based distros usually install 32-bit libraries to `/usr/lib` and 64-bit to `/usr/lib64`.
You may have to change `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to point to correct folders for your distro.

```
CC="gcc -m32" \
CXX="g++ -m32" \
PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/lib32/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig:/usr/lib/pkgconfig" \
meson build32 --libdir lib32
ninja -C build32 install
```

### Dependencies

Install necessary development packages.

- gcc, g++
- or gcc-multilib, g++-multilib for 32-bit support
- meson >=0.54
- ninja (ninja-build)
- glslang
- libGL/libEGL (libglvnd, mesa-common-dev, mesa-libGL-devel etc)
- X11 (libx11-dev)
- XNVCtrl (libxnvctrl-dev), optional, use `-Dwith_xnvctrl=disabled` option with `meson` to disable
- D-Bus (libdbus-1-dev), optional, use `-Dwith_dbus=disabled` option with `meson` to disable

Python 3 libraries:

- Mako (python3-mako or install with `pip`)

If distro's packaged `meson` is too old and gives build errors, install newer version with `pip` (`python3-pip`).

### Building with build script

You can also use `build.sh` script to do some things automatically like install dependencies, if distro is supported but it usually assumes you are running on x86_64 architecture.

To just build it, execute:

```
./build.sh build
```

You can also pass arguments to meson:

```
./build.sh build -Dwith_xnvctrl=disabled
```

Resulting files will be install to `./build/release` folder.

If you have compiled MangoHud from source, to install it, execute:

```
./build.sh install
```

You can then subsequently uninstall MangoHud via the following command

```
./build.sh uninstall
```

To tar up the resulting binaries into a package and create a release tar with installer script, execute:

```
./build.sh package release
```

or combine the commands, although `package` should also call `build` if it doesn't find the built libs:

```
./build.sh build package release
```

If you have built MangoHud before and suddenly it fails, you can try cleaning the `build` folder, execute:

```
./build.sh clean
```

Currently it just does `rm -fr build` and clears subprojects.

__NOTE: If you are running an Ubuntu-based, Arch-based, Fedora-based, or openSUSE-based distro, the build script will automatically detect and prompt you to install missing build dependencies. If you run into any issues with this please report them!__

## Installation - Pre-packaged Binaries

---

### GitHub releases

If you do not wish to compile anything, simply download the file under [Releases](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases), extract it, and from within the extracted folder in terminal, execute:

```
./mangohud-setup.sh install
```

### Arch-based distributions

If you are using an Arch-based distribution, install [`mangohud`](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/mangohud/) and [`lib32-mangohud`](https://archlinux.org/packages/multilib/x86_64/lib32-mangohud/) from the `extra`/`multilib` repository. [`mangohud-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mangohud-git/) and [`lib32-mangohud-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lib32-mangohud-git/) are available on the AUR to be installed via your favourite AUR helper. These can help fix issues with the hud not activating when using stable releases from pacman!

If you are building it by yourself, you need to enable multilib repository, by editing pacman config:

```
sudo nano /etc/pacman.conf
```

and uncomment:

```txt
#[multilib]
#Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
```

then save the file and execute:

```
sudo pacman -Syy
```

### Debian, Ubuntu

If you are using Debian 11 (Bullseye) or later, Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish) or later, or distro derived from them, to install the [MangoHud](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/mangohud) package, execute:

```
sudo apt install mangohud
```

Optionally, if you also need MangoHud for 32-bit applications, execute:

```
sudo apt install mangohud:i386
```

### Fedora

If you are using Fedora, to install the [MangoHud](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mangohud) package, execute:

```
sudo dnf install mangohud
```

### Solus

If you are using Solus, to install [MangoHud](https://dev.getsol.us/source/mangohud/) simply execute:

```
sudo eopkg it mangohud
```

### openSUSE

If you run openSUSE Leap or Tumbleweed you can get Mangohud from the official repositories.
There are two packages, [mangohud](https://software.opensuse.org/package/mangohud) for 64bit and [mangohud-32bit](https://software.opensuse.org/package/mangohud-32bit) for 32bit application support.
To have Mangohud working for both 32bit and 64bit applications you need to install both packages even on a 64bit operating system.

```
sudo zypper in mangohud mangohud-32bit
```

Leap doesn't seem to have the 32bit package.

Leap 15.2

```
sudo zypper addrepo -f https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games:tools/openSUSE_Leap_15.2/games:tools.repo
sudo zypper install mangohud
```

Leap 15.3

```
sudo zypper addrepo -f https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/games:tools/openSUSE_Leap_15.3/games:tools.repo
sudo zypper install mangohud
```

### Flatpak

If you are using Flatpaks, you will have to add the [Flathub repository](https://flatpak.org/setup/) for your specific distribution, and then, to install it, execute:

For flatpak:

```
flatpak install org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.MangoHud
```

To enable MangoHud for all Steam games:

```
flatpak override --user --env=MANGOHUD=1 com.valvesoftware.Steam
```

## Normal usage

---

To enable the MangoHud overlay layer for Vulkan and OpenGL, run :

`mangohud /path/to/app`

For Lutris games, go to the System options in Lutris (make sure that advanced options are enabled) and add this to the `Command prefix` setting:

`mangohud`

For Steam games, you can add this as a launch option:

`mangohud %command%`

Or alternatively, add `MANGOHUD=1` to your shell profile (Vulkan only).

## OpenGL

OpenGL games may also need `dlsym` hooking. Add `--dlsym` to your command like `mangohud --dlsym %command%` for Steam.

Some Linux native OpenGL games overrides LD_PRELOAD and stops MangoHud from working. You can sometimes fix this by editing LD_PRELOAD in the start script
`LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/mangohud/lib/`

## Hud configuration

MangoHud comes with a config file which can be used to set configuration options globally or per application. Usually it is installed as `/usr/share/doc/mangohud/MangoHud.conf.example` or [get a copy from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/master/data/MangoHud.conf).

The priorities of different config files are:

1. `/path/to/application/dir/MangoHud.conf`
2. Per-application configuration in ~/.config/MangoHud:
    1. `~/.config/MangoHud/<application_name>.conf` for native applications, where `<application_name>` is the case sensitive name of the executable
    2. `~/.config/MangoHud/wine-<application_name>.conf` for wine/proton apps, where `<application_name>` is the case sensitive name of the executable without the `.exe` ending
3. `~/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf`

Example: For Overwatch, this would be `wine-Overwatch.conf` (even though the executable you run from Lutris is `Battle.net.exe`, the actual game executable name is `Overwatch.exe`).

If you start the game from the terminal with MangoHud enabled (for example by starting Lutris from the terminal), MangoHud will print the config file names it is looking for.

You can find an example config in /usr/share/doc/mangohud

[GOverlay](https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay) is a GUI application that can be used to manage the config

---

### Environment Variables: **`MANGOHUD_CONFIG`** and **`MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE`**

You can also customize the hud by using the `MANGOHUD_CONFIG` environment variable while separating different options with a comma. This takes priority over any config file.

You can also specify configuration file with `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE=/path/to/config` for applications whose names are hard to guess (java, python etc).

A partial list of parameters are below. See the config file for a complete list.
Parameters that are enabled by default have to be explicitly disabled. These (currently) are `fps`, `frame_timing`, `cpu_stats` (cpu load), `gpu_stats` (gpu load), and each can be disabled by setting the corresponding variable to 0 (e.g., fps=0).

Example: `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=cpu_temp,gpu_temp,position=top-right,height=500,font_size=32`
Because comma is also used as option delimiter and needs to be escaped for values with a backslash, you can use `+` like `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=fps_limit=60+30+0` instead.

*Note: Width and Height are set automatically based on the font_size, but can be overridden.*

*Note: RAPL is currently used for Intel CPUs to show power draw with `cpu_power` which may be unreadable for non-root users due to [vulnerability](https://platypusattack.com/). The corresponding `energy_uj` file has to be readable by corresponding user, e.g. by running `chmod o+r /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl\:0/energy_uj` as root, else the power shown will be **0 W**, though having the file readable may potentially be a security vulnerability persisting until system reboots.*

*Note: The [zenpower3](https://git.exozy.me/a/zenpower3) kernel driver must be installed to show the power draw of Ryzen CPUs.*

## Vsync

### OpenGL Vsync

- `-1` = Adaptive sync
- `0`  = Off
- `1`  = On
- `n`  = Sync to refresh rate / n.

### Vulkan Vsync

- `0` = Adaptive VSync (FIFO_RELAXED_KHR)
- `1` = Off (IMMEDIATE_KHR)
- `2` = Mailbox (VSync with uncapped FPS) (MAILBOX_KHR)
- `3` = On (FIFO_KHR)

Not all vulkan vsync options may be supported on your device, you can check what your device supports here [vulkan.gpuinfo.org](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listsurfacepresentmodes.php?platform=linux)

## Keybindings

- `Shift_L+F2` : Toggle Logging
- `Shift_L+F4` : Reload Config
- `Shift_R+F12` : Toggle Hud

## Workarounds

Options starting with "gl_*" are for OpenGL.

- `gl_size_query = viewport` : Specify what to use for getting display size. Options are "viewport", "scissorbox" or disabled. Defaults to using glXQueryDrawable.
- `gl_bind_framebuffer = 0..N` : (Re)bind given framebuffer before MangoHud gets drawn. Helps with Crusader Kings III.
- `gl_dont_flip = 1` : Don't swap origin if using GL_UPPER_LEFT. Helps with Ryujinx.

## FPS logging

You must set a valid path for `output_folder` in your configuration to store logs in.

When you toggle logging (default keybind is `Shift_L+F2`), a file is created with the game name plus a date & timestamp in your `output_folder`.

Log files can be visualized with two different tools: online and locally.

### Online viualization: FlightlessMango.com
Log files can be (batch) uploaded to [FlightlessMango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks), which will then take care of creating a frametime graph and a summary with 1% min / average framerate / 97th percentile in a table form and a horizontal bar chart form.

Notes:
- Uploaded benchmarks are public: you can share them with anyone by simply giving them the link.
- Benchmark filenames are used as legend in the produced tables and graphs, they can be renamed after the upload.

### Local visualization: `mangoplot`
`mangoplot` is a plotting script that is shipped with `MangoHud`: on a given folder, it takes each log file, makes a 1D heatmap of its framerates, then stacks the heats maps vertically to form a 2D graph for easy visual comparison between benchmarks.
