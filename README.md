# Installation

If you do not wish to compile anything, simply download the file under Releases, extract it, and run `./install.sh` from within the extracted folder.

If you wish to compile MangoHud to keep up to date with any changes - first clone this repository and cd into it:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud.git
cd MangoHud
```

Then simply run the following command:

`./build.sh install`

This will build and copy `libMangoHud.so` & `libMangoHud32.so` to `$HOME/.local/share/MangoHud`, as well as copying the required Vulkan layer configuration files.

---

If you are running an Ubuntu-like distribution, Fedora, or Arch, the build script will automatically detect and prompt you to install missing build dependencies. If you run into any issues with this please report them!

## Packaging status

[Fedora](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mangohud): `sudo dnf install mangohud`

[Arch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mangohud): Install `mangohud` and `lib32-mangohud` with your favourite AUR helper. `mangohud-git` is also available on the AUR.

# Normal usage

To enable the MangoHud Vulkan overlay layer, run :

`MANGOHUD=1 /path/to/my_vulkan_app`

Or alternatively, add `MANGOHUD=1` to your shell profile.

## Hud configuration

MangoHud comes with a config file which can be used to set configuration options globally or per application. The priorities of different config files are:

1. `/path/to/application/dir/MangoHud.conf`
2. `$HOME/.config/MangoHud/{application_name}.conf`
3. `$HOME/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf`
4. `$HOME/.local/share/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf`

The default config file is installed to `$HOME/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf` and will not be overwritten by the script.

---

### `MANGOHUD_CONFIG` environment variable

You can also customize the hud by using the `MANGOHUD_CONFIG` environment variable while separating different options with a comma. This takes priority over any config file.

A partial list of parameters are below. See the config file for a complete list.

| Variable                           | Description                                                                           |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cpu_temp`<br>`gpu_temp`           | Displays current CPU/GPU temperature                                                  |
| `core_load`                        | Displays load & frequency per core                                                    |
| `ram`<br>`vram`                    | Displays system RAM/VRAM usage                                                        |
| `full`                             | Enables all of the above config options                                               |
| `crosshair`                        | Adds a crosshair overlay at the centre of the screen                                  |
| `font_size=`                       | Customizeable font size (default=24)                                                  |
| `width=`<br>`height=`              | Customizeable hud dimensions (in pixels)                                              |
| `position=`                        | Location of the hud: `top-left` (default), `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right` |
| `no_display`                       | Hide the hud by default                                                               |
| `toggle_hud=`<br>`toggle_logging=` | Modifiable toggle hotkeys. Default are F12 and F2, respectively.                      |

Note: Width and Height are set automatically based on the font_size, but can be overridden.

Example: `MANGOHUD_CONFIG=cpu_temp,gpu_temp,position=top-right,height=500,font_size=32`

## Environment Variables

- `MANGOHUD_OUTPUT` : Define name and location of the output file (Required for logging)
- `MANGOHUD_FONT`: Change default font (set location to .TTF/.OTF file )

## Keybindings

- `F2` : Toggle Logging
- `F12`: Toggle Hud

## MangoHud FPS logging

When you toggle logging (using the keybind `F2`), a file is created with your chosen name (using `MANGOHUD_OUTPUT`) plus a date & timestamp.

This file can be uploaded to [Flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks) to create graphs automatically.
you can share the created page with others, just link it.

#### Multiple log files

It's possible to upload multiple files when using [Flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks). You can rename them to your preferred names and upload them in a batch.
These filenames will be used as the legend in the graph.
