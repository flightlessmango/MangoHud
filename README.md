# Installation

## Build

If you wish to compile MangoHud to keep up to date with any changes - first clone this repository and cd into it:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud.git
cd MangoHud
```

To build it, execute:

```
./build.sh build
./build.sh package
```

**NOTE: If you are running an Ubuntu-based, Arch-based, Fedora-based, or openSUSE-based distro, the build script will automatically detect and prompt you to install missing build dependencies. If you run into any issues with this please report them!**

Once done, proceed to the [installation](#source).

## Install

### Source

If you have compiled MangoHud from source, to install it, execute:

```
./build.sh install
```

You can then subsequently uninstall MangoHud via the following command

```
./build.sh uninstall
```

### Pre-packaged binaries

#### GitHub releases

If you do not wish to compile anything, simply download the file under [Releases](https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud/releases), extract it, and from within the extracted folder in terminal, execute:

```
./mangohud-setup.sh install
```

#### Arch-based distributions

If you are using an Arch-based distribution, install [`mangohud`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mangohud/) and [`lib32-mangohud`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lib32-mangohud/) with your favourite AUR helper. [`mangohud-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mangohud-git/) and [`lib32-mangohud-git`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/lib32-mangohud-git/) are also available on the AUR if you want the up-to-date version of MangoHud.

#### Fedora

If you are using Fedora, to install the [MangoHud](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/mangohud) package, execute:

```
sudo dnf install mangohud
```

#### Flatpak

If you are using Flatpaks, you will have to add the [Flathub repository](https://flatpak.org/setup/) for your specific distribution, and then, to install it, execute:

##### For Steam flatpak
```
flatpak install com.valvesoftware.Steam.Utility.MangoHud
```
To enable MangoHud for all Steam games:
```
flatpak override --user --env=MANGOHUD=1 com.valvesoftware.Steam
```

# Normal usage

To enable the MangoHud overlay layer for 64bit Vulkan and OpenGL, run :

`mangohud /path/to/app`

Or

`mangohud.x86 /path/to/app` for 32bit OpenGL

For Lutris games, go to the System options in Lutris (make sure that advanced options are enabled) and add this to the `Command prefix` setting:

`mangohud`

For Steam games, you can add this as a launch option:

`mangohud %command%`

Or alternatively, add `MANGOHUD=1` to your shell profile (Vulkan only).

## OpenGL

OpenGL games may also need `dlsym` hooking. Add `MANGOHUD_DLSYM=1` to your command like `MANGOHUD_DLSYM=1 mangohud %command%` for Steam.

Some Linux native OpenGL games overrides LD_PRELOAD and stops MangoHud from working. You can sometimes fix this by editing LD_PRELOAD in the start script
`LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/mangohud/lib/`

## Hud configuration

MangoHud comes with a config file which can be used to set configuration options globally or per application. The priorities of different config files are:

1. `/path/to/application/dir/MangoHud.conf`
2. `$HOME/.config/MangoHud/{application_name}.conf`
3. `$HOME/.config/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf`

You can find an example config in /usr/share/doc/mangohud

[GOverlay](https://github.com/benjamimgois/goverlay) is a GUI application that can be used to manage the config

---

### `MANGOHUD_CONFIG` and `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE` environment variables

You can also customize the hud by using the `MANGOHUD_CONFIG` environment variable while separating different options with a comma. This takes priority over any config file.

You can also specify configuration file with `MANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE=/path/to/config` for applications whose names are hard to guess (java, python etc).

A partial list of parameters are below. See the config file for a complete list.

## Vsync
### OpenGL Vsync
- `-1` = Adaptive sync
- `0`  = Off
- `1`  = On
- `n`  = Sync to refresh rate / n.

### Vulkan Vsync
- `0` = Adaptive VSync (FIFO_RELAXED_KHR)
- `1` = Off (IMMEDIATE_KHR)
- `2` = Mailbox (VSync with uncapped FPS) (MAILBOX_KHR)
- `3` = On (FIFO_KHR)

All vulkan vsync options might not be supported on your device, you can check what your device supports here [vulkan.gpuinfo.org](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/listsurfacepresentmodes.php?platform=linux)

## Keybindings

- `Shift_L+F2` : Toggle Logging
- `Shift_L+F4` : Reload Config
- `Shift_R+F12`: Toggle Hud

## MangoHud FPS logging

When you toggle logging (using the keybind `Shift_L+F2`), a file is created with your chosen name (using `output_file`) plus a date & timestamp.

This file can be uploaded to [Flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks) to create graphs automatically.
you can share the created page with others, just link it.

#### Multiple log files

It's possible to upload multiple files when using [Flightlessmango.com](https://flightlessmango.com/games/user_benchmarks). You can rename them to your preferred names and upload them in a batch.
These filenames will be used as the legend in the graph.
