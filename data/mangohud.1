.SH NAME
mangohud \- enable MangoHud on any application

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmangohud\fR [--dlsym] COMMAND

.SH DESCRIPTION
MangoHud is a Vulkan/OpenGL overlay for monitoring FPS, temperatures, CPU/GPU load and more.

.SH USAGE
MangoHud can be enabled for Vulkan applications by setting \fBMANGOHUD=1\fR as envrionment variable.
.br
To load MangoHud for any application, including OpenGL applications, the \fBmangohud\fR executable can be used. It preloads a library via ld into the application.
.br
Note: some OpenGL applications may also need dlsym hooking. This can be done by passing option \fB--dlsym\fR or by setting \fBMANGOHUD_DLSYM=1\fR as envrionment variable.

.SH CONFIG
MangoHud comes with a config file which can be used to set configuration options globally or per application. The priorities of different config files are:
.LP
.RS 4
/path/to/application/MangoHud.conf
.br
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MangoHud/{application_name}.conf
.br
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/MangoHud/MangoHud.conf
.RS -4
.LP
An example config file is located in /usr/share/doc/mangohud/MangoHud.conf, containing all available options.
.LP
A custom config file location can also be specified with the \fBMANGOHUD_CONFIGFILE\fR envrionment variable.
.br
Config options can also be set with the \fBMANGOHUD_CONFIG\fR envrionment variable. This takes priority over any config file.

.SH EXAMPLES
OpenGL: \fBmangohud glxgears\fR
.br
Vulkan: \fBMANGOHUD=1 vkcube\fR
.br
Steam: set your launch option to \fBmangohud %command%\fR
.br
Lutris: add \fBmangohud\fR to the Command prefix setting
.br
OpenGL with dlsym: \fBMANGOHUD_DLSYM=1 mangohud glxgears\fR
.br
Custom config options: \fBMANGOHUD_CONFIG="gpu_stats=0,font_size=12" mangohud glxgears\fR
